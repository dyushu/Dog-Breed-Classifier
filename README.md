# Dog-Breed-Classifier

Udacity DSND Project.

## Overview

This project is part of Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree. The aim of the project is to build and train a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify primarily the breed of dog, if the CNN is displayed an image. If the model is supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed. The final trained model was then deployed into an application which could be fed photos.
